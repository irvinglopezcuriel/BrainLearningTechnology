# Documentation

## Overview

Neurosdk is a powerful tool for working with neuro-sensors BrainBit, BrainBitBlack, Callibri and Kolibri. All these devices work with BLE 4.0+ technology. SDK is available for the following platforms: Android (Java, Kotlin), iOS/MacOS (Objective-C, Swift), Windows (c++, c#, python), ReactNative (Android, iOS), Unity (Android, iOS, Windows, MacOS), Xamarin (Android, iOS, UWP). SDK allows you to connect, read the parameters of devices, as well as receive signals of various types from the selected device. 

## Getting Started

Firstly, you need to install package. 

## Windows (cpp)

Add .dll to your project by your preferred way.

## Work with the SDK

SDK can be conditionally divided into two parts: device search (Scanner object) and the device itself (Sensor object).

The scanner allows you to find devices nearby, it is also responsible for the first creation of the device. When created, the device is automatically connected. In the future, the connection state can be controlled through the sensor object. Whatever type of device you work with, the use of the scanner will be the same.

The sensor allows you to monitor the status of the device, set parameters, receive a signal of various types. 

>It is recommended to work with both parts in a separate thread. During the connection, the SDK also reads the main characteristics of the device, which significantly increases the time of the connection method, which will cause the application to freeze.

If an error occurs while working with the library, you will receive an exception for any of the methods.

### Errors

Here is a list of exceptions that occur when working with SDK. You need to be guided by this list in order to understand what happened in the process of executing a particular method.

| 124 |Failed add callback the sensor                           |

### Scanner

The scanner works like this:

1. Create scanner. 
When creating a scanner, you need to specify the type of device to search. It can be either one device or several. Here is example for two type of devices - BrainBit and Callibri.

###### C++
```cpp
SensorFamily filter[] = {
			    SensorFamily::SensorLEBrainBit,
			    SensorFamily::SensorLECallibri,
		    };
OpStatus st;
auto scanner = createScanner(filter, sizeof(filter), &st);
```
2. During the search, you can get a list of found devices using a callback. To do this, you need to subscribe to receive the event, and unsubscribe after the search is completed:

###### C++
```cpp
void sensorsCallback(SensorScanner* ptr, SensorInfo* sensors, int32_t szSensors, void* userData){
    
}
...
OpStatus st;
SensorsListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addSensorsCallbackScanner(scanner, sensorsCallback, &lHandle, nullptr, &st);
```

3. Start search
###### C++
```cpp
OpStatus outStatus;

startScanner(scanner, &outStatus);
```

3. Stop search

###### C++
```cpp
OpStatus outStatus;

stopScanner(scanner, &outStatus);
```

4. Additionally, a list of found devices can be obtained using a separate method.

###### C++
```cpp
int32_t szSensorsInOut = 32;
SensorInfo* sensors = new SensorInfo[szSensorsInOut];
OpStatus outStatus;
sensorsScanner(scanner, sensors, &szSensorsInOut, &outStatus);
```

`SensorInfo` contains information about device:
 - Name - the name of device
 - Address - MAC address of device (UUID for iOS/MacOS)
 - Serial number - device's serial number
 - Sensor family - type of device
 - Sensor model - numerical value of the device model
 - Pairing requared - whether the device needs to be paired or not

5. After you finish working with the scanner, you need to clean up the resources used. 

###### C++
```cpp
freeScanner(scanner);
```

> Important!
> When restarting the search, the callback will only be called when a new device is found. If you need to get all devices found by the current scanner instance, call the appropriate method.


### Sensor

#### Creating

You need to create a device using a scanner. All manipulations with the device will be performed without errors only if the device is connected.

###### C++
```cpp
OpStatus outStatus;
SensorInfo sensorInfo;
Sensor* sensor = createSensor(scanner, sensorInfo, &outStatus);
```

> Device creation is a blocking method, so it must be called from separate thread.

> For all types of devices, you can use the same methods to control the device's connection status, invoke commands, and check for functionality.

#### Manage connection state

Connection status can be obtained in two ways. The first one is using the sensor property `State`.

The second way is in real time using a callback:

###### C++
```cpp
void onConnectionStateCallback(Sensor* sensor, SensorState State, void* userInfo)
{

}

OpStatus outStatus;
SensorStateListenerHandle lhandle = nullptr;
addConnectionStateCallback(sensor, onConnectionStateCallback, &lhandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
```

A connection can be in two states: connected (InRange) and disconnected (OutOfRange).

> Important!
> The state change callback will not come after the device is created, only after disconnecting (device lost from the scope or using a method) and then connected. The device does not automatically reconnect.

You can connect and disconnect from device manually by methods `Connect()` and `Disconnect()`. To receive connection state in real time you need to subscribe to `stateChanged` event. Also you can get connection state by sensor's property.

###### C++
```cpp
OpStatus outStatus;
connectSensor(sensor, &outStatus);

disconnectSensor(sensor, &outStatus);
```

> Method `Connect` is blocking too, so it need to be call from separate thread.

#### Manage device parameters

##### Battery

Also, you can get power value from each device by sensor property `BattPower` or by callback in real time:

###### C++
```cpp
void onBatteryCallback(Sensor* sensor, int32_t battery, void* userData)
{

}

OpStatus outStatus;
BattPowerListenerHandle lhandle = nullptr;
addBatteryCallback(sensor, onBatteryCallback, &lhandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
```

##### Parameters

Each device has its own settings, and some of them can be configured as you need. Not all settings can be changed and not every device supports all settings.

First you need to find out what parameters the device supports and whether they can be changed:

###### C++
```cpp
int32_t szSensorParametersInOut = getParametersCountSensor(sensor);
ParameterInfo sensor_parameter[szSensorParametersInOut];
OpStatus outStatus;
getParametersSensor(sensor, sensor_parameter, &szSensorParametersInOut, &outStatus);
```

Info about parameter includes two fields:
 - the name of the parameter, represented by an enumeration
 - parameter availability for manipulation. Can be one of three values:
   - read - read-only
   - read and write - parameter can be changed
   - read and notify - parameter is updated over time

You can also check if the parameter is supported, for example `Gain`:

###### C++
```cpp
if(isSupportedParameterSensor(sensor, SensorParameter::ParameterGain)){
    ...
}
```

##### Parameter description

###### Name

Name of device. String value.

###### State

Information about the connection status of a device. Can take two values:

- InRange - Device connected
- OutOfRange - The device is turned off or out of range

###### Address

MAC-address of device. For iOS/MacOS represents by UUID. String value.

###### SerialNumber

Serial number of device.  String value.

For callibri device families, this field is empty in `SensorInfo` when searching, and you can get it immediately after connecting using this property.

###### HardwareFilterState

An property that is used to set or get the sample rate of a physiological signal. The higher the value, the more data flow from the device to the application, which means the higher the power consumption, but also the higher the range of measured frequencies. And there are also limitations on the physical communication channel (BLE) in terms of bandwidth.

Recommendations for choosing a value:

- For EEG signals not less than 250 Hz;
- For ECG signals 125 Hz;
- For EMG not less than 1000 Hz. When working with several devices at the same time, it is not recommended to increase the frequency above 1000 Hz;
- The breath channel has a fixed sampling rate of 20 Hertz. MEMS channels have a fixed sampling rate of 100 Hertz.

It is unchanged for BrainBit and BrainBitBlack and is 250 Hz. Can be changed for Signal Callibri/Kolibri and can take on the following values:

###### C++
```cpp
int32_t szSensorFeatureInOut = getFeaturesCountSensor(sensor);
SensorFeature features[szSensorFeatureInOut];
OpStatus outStatus;
getFeaturesSensor(sensor, features, &szSensorFeatureInOut, &outStatus);
```

You can also check if the feature is supported, for example `Signal`:

###### C++
```cpp
if(isSupportedFeatureSensor(sensor, SensorFeature::FeatureSignal)){

}
```

##### Commands

The device can execute certain commands. The list of supported commands can be obtained as follows:

###### C++
```cpp
auto* sensor = reinterpret_cast<Sensor*>(sensor_ptr);
int32_t szSensorCommandsInOut = getCommandsCountSensor(sensor);
SensorCommand commands[szSensorCommandsInOut];

getCommandsSensor(sensor, commands, &szSensorCommandsInOut, &outStatus);
```

And also check if the device can execute the desired command:

###### C++
```cpp
if(isSupportedCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartSignal)){

}
```

### BrainBit, BrainBitBlack

The BrainBit and BrainBitBlack is a headband with 4 electrodes and 4 data channels - O1, O2, T3, T4. The device has a frequency of 250 Hz, which means that data on each of the channels will come at a frequency of 250 samples per second. The parameters of this device, such as gain, data offset and the other, cannot be changed, if you try to do this, an exception will appear.

###### C#
```csharp
sensor.Gain = SensorGain.SensorGain1; // <- This throw an exeption!
```

>  You can distinguish BrainBit device from Flex by the firmware version number: if the `SensorVersion.FwMajor` is more than 100 - it's Flex, if it's less than BrainBit.

> BrainBitBlack, unlike BrainBit, requires pairing with a PC/mobile device. So, before connecting to the BBB, you must put it into pairing mode. SDK starts the pairing process automatically. 



#### Receiving signal

To receive signal data, you need to subscribe to the corresponding callback. The values will be received as a packet from four channels at once, which will avoid desynchronization between them. The values come in volts. In order for the device to start transmitting data, you need to start a signal using the `execute` command. This method is also recommended to be run in an separate thread.

###### C++
```cpp
void onBrainBitSignalDataReceived(Sensor *pSensor, BrainBitSignalData *pData, int32_t size, void *userData)
{

}
OpStatus outStatus;
BrainBitSignalDataListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addSignalDataCallbackBrainBit(_sensor, onBrainBitSignalDataReceived, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(_sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartSignal, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(_sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopSignal, &outStatus);
removeSignalDataCallbackBrainBit(lHandle);
```

You get signal values as a list of samples, each containing:
 - PackNum -  number for each packet
 - Marker - marker of sample, if it was sent and this feature is supported by the device
 - O1 - value of O1 channel in V
 - O2 - value of O2 channel in V
 - T3 - value of T3 channel in V
 - T4 - value of T4 channel in V

#### Ping signal

Some devices support signal quality check functions using signal ping. You can send a specific value (marker) to the device and it will return that marker with the next signal data packet. Marker is small value one byte in size.

> Available only to BrainBitBlack

###### C++
```cpp
OpStatus outStatus;
pingNeuroSmart(sensor, 5, &outStatus);
```

#### Recieving resistance

BrainBit and BrainBitBlack also allow you to get resistance values. With their help, you can determine the quality of the electrodes to the skin. Initial resistance values are infinity. The values change when the BB is on the head.

For BrainBit the upper limit of resistance is 2.5 ohms.

###### C++
```cpp
void onBrainBitBlackResistDataReceived(Sensor *pSensor, BrainBitResistData data, void *pVoid)
{

}
OpStatus outStatus;
BrainBitResistDataListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addResistCallbackBrainBit(_sensor, onBrainBitBlackResistDataReceived, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(_sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartResist, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(_sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopResist, &outStatus);
removeResistCallbackBrainBit(lHandle);
```

You get resistance values structure of samples for each channel:
 - O1 - value of O1 channel in Ohm
 - O2 - value of O2 channel in Ohm
 - T3 - value of T3 channel in Ohm
 - T4 - value of T4 channel in Ohm

### Signal Callibri, Kolibri

The Callibri family of devices has a wide range of built-in modules. For each of these modules, the SDK contains its own processing area. It is recommended before using any of the modules to check if the module is supported by the device using one of the methods `IsSupportedFeature`, `IsSupportedCommand` or `IsSupportedParameter`

#### Receiving signal

To receive signal data, you need to subscribe to the corresponding callback. The values come in volts. In order for the device to start transmitting data, you need to start a signal using the `execute` command. This method is also recommended to be run in an separate thread.

The sampling rate can be controlled using the `SamplingFrequency` property. For example, at a frequency of 1000 Hz, the device will send 1000 samples per second. Supports frequencies 125/250/500/1000/2000 Hz. You can also adjust the signal offset (`DataOffset`) and signal power (`Gain`).

###### C++
```cpp
void onCallibriSignalDataReceived(Sensor* sensor, CallibriSignalData* data, int32_t size, void* sensor_jobj)
{

}
OpStatus outStatus;
CallibriSignalDataListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addSignalCallbackCallibri(sensor, onCallibriSignalDataReceived, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartSignal, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopSignal, &outStatus);
removeSignalCallbackCallibri(lHandle);
```

You get signal values as a list of samples, each containing:
 - PackNum -  number for each packet
 - array of samples in V


#### Signal settings

By default, the Callibri/Kolibri gives a signal without filters. In order to receive a certain type of signal, for example, EEG or ECG, you need to configure the device in a certain way. For this there is a property `SignalTypeCallibri`. Preset signal types include:
 - EEG - parameters: Gain6, Offset = 3,  ADCInputResistance
 - EMG - parameters: Gain6, Offset = 3,  ADCInputResistance
 - ECG - parameters: Gain6, Offset = 3,  ADCInputResistance
 - EDA (GSR) - parameters: Gain6, Offset = 8,  ADCInputResistance, ExternalSwitchInputMioElectrodes. By default the input to the terminals is set. If you want to change it to USB use the `ExtSwInput` property.
 - StrainGaugeBreathing - parameters: Gain6, Offset = 4,  ADCInputResistance, ExternalSwitchInputMioUSB
 - ImpedanceBreathing - parameters: Gain6, Offset = 4,  ADCInputResistance, ExternalSwitchInputRespUSB

Hardware filters disabled by default for all signal types. You can enable filters by `HardwareFilters` property, for example LP filter. 

> Important!
> When using an LP filter in the sensor, you will not see the constant component of the signal.


#### Receiving envelope

To get the values of the envelope, you need to subscribe to a specific event and start pickup. The channel must be configured in the same way as for a normal signal, and all parameters work the same way. Then the signal is filtered and decimated at 20 Hz.

###### C++
```cpp
void onCallibriEnvelopeDataReceived(Sensor* sensor, CallibriEnvelopeData* data, int32_t size, void* sensor_jobj)
{

}
OpStatus outStatus;
CallibriEnvelopeDataListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addEnvelopeDataCallbackCallibri(sensor, onCallibriEnvelopeDataReceived, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartEnvelope, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopEnvelope, &outStatus);
removeEnvelopeDataCallbackCallibri(lHandle);
```

You get signal values as a list of samples, each containing:
 - PackNum - number for each packet
 - sample in V

#### Check electrodes state

Allows you to determine the presence of electrical contact of the device electrodes with human skin. It can be in three states:
 - Normal - The electrodes have normal skin contact. Low electrical resistance between electrodes. The expected state when working with physiological signals.
 - Detached - High electrical resistance between electrodes. High probability of interference in the physiological signal.
 - HighResistance - There is no electrical contact between the electrodes of the device.
 
To receive data, you need to subscribe to the corresponding callback and start signal pickup.

###### C++
```cpp
void onCallibriElectrodeStateChanged(Sensor* sensor, CallibriElectrodeState state, void* userData)
{

}
OpStatus outStatus;
CallibriElectrodeStateListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addElectrodeStateCallbackCallibri(sensor, onCallibriElectrodeStateChanged, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartSignal, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopSignal, &outStatus);
removeElectrodeStateCallbackCallibri(lHandle);
```

You get signal values as a list of samples, each containing:
 - PackNum - number for each packet
 - sample in V

#### Receiving Respiration

The breathing microcircuit is optional on request. Its presence can be checked using the `IsSupportedFeature` method. To receive data, you need to connect to the device, subscribe to the notification of data receipt and start picking up.

###### C++
```cpp
void onCallibriRespirationDataReceived(Sensor* sensor, CallibriRespirationData *pData, int32_t size, void* userData)
{

}

if(isSupportedFeatureSensor(sensor, SensorFeature::FeatureRespiration)){
    OpStatus outStatus;
    CallibriRespirationDataListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
    addRespirationCallbackCallibri(sensor, onCallibriRespirationDataReceived, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
    execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartRespiration, &outStatus);
    ...
    execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopRespiration, &outStatus);
    removeRespirationCallbackCallibri(lHandle);
}
```

You get signal values as a list of samples, each containing:
 - PackNum - number for each packet
 - array of samples in V

#### MEMS

The MEMS microcircuit is optional on request. Its presence can be checked using the `IsSupportedFeature` method. This means that the device contains an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Contains information about the position of the device in space. Channel sampling frequency is 100 Hz.

MEMS data is a structure:

- PackNum - number for each packet
- Accelerometer - accelerometer data. Contains:
  - X - Abscissa Acceleration
  - Y - Y-axis acceleration
  - Z - Acceleration along the applicate axis
- Gyroscope - gyroscope data
  - X - The angle of inclination along the abscissa axis
  - Y - Inclination angle along the ordinate axis
  - Z - Angle of inclination along the axis of the applicate

Quaternion data is a structure:

- PackNum - number for each packet
- W - Rotation component
- X - Vector abscissa coordinate
- Y - Vector coordinate along the ordinate axis
- Z - The coordinate of the vector along the axis of the applicate

It is recommended to perform calibration on a flat, horizontal non-vibrating surface before starting work using the `CalibrateMEMS` command. Calibration state can be checked using the `MEMSCalibrateStateCallibri` property, it can take only two values: calibrated (true), not calibrated (false).

> MEMS and quaternion available only to signal Callibri/Kolibri!

###### C++
```cpp
void onMEMSDataCallbackCallibri(Sensor* sensor, MEMSData* data, int32_t size, void* userData){

}
void onQuaternionDataCallbackCallibri(Sensor* sensor, QuaternionData* data, int32_t size, void* userData){

}

OpStatus outStatus;
// Calibration
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandCalibrateMEMS, &outStatus);
uint8_t state = 0;
readMEMSCalibrateStateCallibri(sensor, &state, &outStatus);
bool calibrated = state != 0;

// For receiving MEMS
OpStatus outStatus;
MEMSDataListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addMEMSDataCallback(sensor, onMEMSDataCallbackCallibri, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartMEMS, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopMEMS, &outStatus);
removeMEMSDataCallback(lHandle);

// For quaternion
QuaternionDataListenerHandle lHandle = nullptr;
addQuaternionDataCallback(sensor, onQuaternionDataCallbackCallibri, &lHandle, nullptr, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartAngle, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopAngle, &outStatus);
removeQuaternionDataCallback(lHandle);
```

#### Motion counter

Represents a motion counter. It can be configured using the `CallibriMotionCounterParam` property, in it:

 - InsensThreshmG – Threshold of the algorithm's deadness in amplitude (in mg). The maximum value is 500mg. The minimum value is 0.
 - InsensThreshSamp - Threshold of the algorithm's insensitivity in time (in samples with the MEMS sampling rate). The maximum value is 500 samples. The minimum value is 0.

You can find out the current number of movements using the `MotionCounterCallibri` property. You can reset the counter with the `ResetMotionCounter` command. No additional commands are needed to start the counter, it will be incremented all the time until the reset command is executed.

###### C++
```cpp
if(isSupportedParameterSensor(sensor, SensorParameter::ParameterMotionCounter)){
    OpStatus outStatus;
    uint32_t count = 0;
    readMotionCounterCallibri(sensor, &count, &outStatus);
    execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandResetMotionCounter, &outStatus);
}
```

### Callibri/Kolibri EMS

Kallibri is a EMS if it supports the stimulation module:

###### C++
```cpp
bool isStimulator = isSupportedFeatureSensor(sensor, SensorFeature::FeatureCurrentStimulator);
```

#### Stimulation

Before starting the session, you need to correctly configure the device, otherwise the current strength may be too strong or the duration of stimulation too long. The setting is done using the `StimulatorParamCallibri` property. You can set the following options:

 - Current - stimulus amplitude in  mA. 1..100
 - PulseWidth - duration of the stimulating pulse by us. 20..460
 - Frequency - frequency of stimulation impulses by Hz. 1..200.
 - StimulusDuration - maximum stimulation time by ms. 0...65535. Zero is infinitely.

You can start and stop stimulation with the following commands:

###### C++
```cpp
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartCurrentStimulation, &outStatus);
...
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStopCurrentStimulation, &outStatus);
```

> Stimulation does not stop after the `StimulusDuration` time has elapsed.

You can check the state of stimulation using the `StimulatorMAStateCallibri` property. Contains two parameters:

- StimulatorState - Stimulation mode state
- MAState - Drive assistant mode state

Each of the parameters can be in 4 states:

- StimStateNoParams - parameter not set
- StimStateDisabled - mode disabled
- StimStateEnabled - mode enabled
- StimStateUnsupported - sensor unsupported

#### Motion assistant

The Callibri EMS, which contains the MEMS module, can act as a motion corrector. You can set the initial and final angle of the device and the limb on which the Callibri/Kolibri is installed, as well as a pause between stimulations and turn on the motion assistant. All the time while the device is tilted in the set range, stimulation will met. Stimulation will take place according to the settings of `StimulatorParamCallibri`.

The motion corrector works in the background. After turning on the motion assistant mode, it will work regardless of the connection to a mobile device/PC. You can turn on the motion corrector mode using a special command. When the device is rebooted, it is also reset.

Motion corrector parameters are a structure with fields:

 - GyroStart - Angle value in degrees at which the stimulation mode will start, if it is correctly configured.
 - GyroStop - Angle value in degrees above which the stimulation mode will stop, if it is correctly configured.
 - Limb - overlay location in stimulation mode, if supported.
 - MinPauseMs - Pause between starts of stimulation mode in milliseconds. Multiple of 10. This means that the device is using the (MinPauseMs / 10) value. Correct values: 10, 20, 30, 40 ... 

###### C++
```cpp
OpStatus outStatus;
CallibriMotionAssistantParams callibriMotionAssistantParams;
callibriMotionAssistantParams.GyroStart = 45;
callibriMotionAssistantParams.GyroStart = 10;
callibriMotionAssistantParams.GyroStart = CallibriMotionAssistantLimb::MALimbRightLeg;
callibriMotionAssistantParams.GyroStart = 10;
writeMotionAssistantParamCallibri(sensor, callibriMotionAssistantParams, &outStatus);
execCommandSensor(sensor, SensorCommand::CommandStartCurrentStimulation, &outStatus);
```
